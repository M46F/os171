I've done  Intro to Git and Intro to CLI and now going to do Intro to Scripting
and actually I learn how to be patience and read instruction one by one and not skipping anything
thanks to this task I search how to for loops on bash and it works
err and now I know that I am geek(not normal) since I use vim instead of nano?
